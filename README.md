  ## Description  
  This Weather Dashboard application is designed so a user can search by city name and will be presented with the current weather and the 5-day forecast for that location. 

  Additionally, the application will store all previous city searches in a list on the left side of the screen. The user can click on any of the previous searches to see the weather for that location again. The user can also clear the search history by clicking the "Clear History" button.

  The application uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data. The data is then displayed on the screen using dynamically created HTML elements. The application also uses local storage to store the search history so that the user can see their previous searches when they return to the application.

  The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The JavaScript code uses jQuery to make AJAX calls to the OpenWeather API and to dynamically create the HTML elements that display the weather data. The application is responsive and uses Bootstrap to ensure that it looks good on all screen sizes.
